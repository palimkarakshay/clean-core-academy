 * Content-pack selection.

 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENT_PACK_ID` environment variable. The webpack
 * alias `@active-pack` points at `content-packs/<id>/`, so the
 * import in `src/content/active-pack.ts` resolves to the selected
 * pack and tree-shaking eliminates inactive packs from the bundle.
 *
 * Default (no env var): `cca-f-prep`. To run a parallel Vercel
 * deploy for a different pack, set
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENT_PACK_ID=<pack-id>` in the project env vars.
 *
 * The id is also exposed to client code via the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
 * convention, which is how `src/content/active-pack.ts` selects
 * the right pack from the registry as a runtime safety net.

 * - `connect-src` allows claude.ai for the Ask-AI hand-off; expand only
 *   when a pack ships an additional outbound destination.
 * - `frame-ancestors 'none'` blocks clickjacking.
 * - `object-src 'none'` blocks Flash / Java / pdf-plugin abuse.
 * - `upgrade-insecure-requests` forces http subresources to https.
