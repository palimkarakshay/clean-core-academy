   Pack registry.

   Every pack ships a static export. The registry is the runtime
   index of all packs the app knows about. Add a new pack by:
     1. Authoring `web/content-packs/<your-pack>/`.
     2. Adding the import + entry below.

   Pack lookup happens at request time from the URL `[packId]`
   segment (see `app/[packId]/layout.tsx`). Build-time env-var
   single-pack mode (NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTENT_PACK_ID) is preserved as a
   backward-compat fallback for existing parallel-Vercel deploys.

  Order matters: `Object.values(PACK_REGISTRY)` preserves insertion
  order, and the consumer picker on `/` renders in that order.

  Clean Core Academy is the single consumer course this shell delivers,
  so it leads (and is the DEFAULT_PACK_ID fallback). `acme-onboarding`
  is the shell's built-in B2B demo fixture — it stays registered so the
  audience-filter / B2B contract tests keep a fixture, but it never
  appears on the consumer picker (audience: "b2b") and the Adept surface
  that would surface it is disabled via NEXT_PUBLIC_ADEPT_ENABLED=0.
