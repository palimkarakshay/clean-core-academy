   Mini-game catalog — pack-agnostic.

   PR2 ships all six tiles in `status: "soon"`. PR3 flips Time Trivia
   to `"live"`. PR4 flips Flashcard Battle. Subsequent PRs (PR5+) flip
   the rest. Each pack consumes the SAME catalog — game implementations
   themselves accept Section/Concept/Flashcard as props so they work
   for any curriculum.
