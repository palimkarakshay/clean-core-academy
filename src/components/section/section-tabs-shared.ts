   Shared types + helpers for SectionTabs.

   Lives in its own (non-"use client") module so the server-rendered
   section page can call resolveTab() against the URL search-param
   while the client SectionTabs component stays in a "use client"
   file. Next.js forbids server -> client function calls; pulling
   resolveTab here means both layers can import it.
